Final Project: Developed a computer application that detects and tracks the movement of a rectangular object in real-time.<br> 
The application is designed to focus on changes that occur in the scope of the object and gives efficient monitoring of changes which occur on rectangular objects, such as screens, pieces of paper, or even a window in a building.<br> 
It was written in Python using packages such as OpenCV, NumPy, SciPy, and SymPy, and based on many algorithms and techniques found in image processing and motion detection.
